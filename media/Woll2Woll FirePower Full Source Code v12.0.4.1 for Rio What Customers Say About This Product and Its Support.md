One of the questions that you may have when choosing Woll2Woll FirePower is whether you should use FireMonkey or VCL for your application development. FireMonkey and VCL are both frameworks that provide a set of components and tools for creating user interfaces in RAD Studio. However, they have some differences and advantages that you should consider.
 
FireMonkey is a cross-platform framework that allows you to create applications that run on multiple devices and operating systems with a single codebase. You can target Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux with FireMonkey. FireMonkey also supports 3D graphics, animations, effects, and styles that can give your application a modern and attractive look. FireMonkey uses a single precision floating point number instead of an integer in laying out the controls, which makes it more flexible and precise.
 
VCL is a Windows-only framework that allows you to create applications that run on Windows 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. VCL has a long history and a large user base, which means that it has more third-party components and libraries available. VCL also has better integration with Windows APIs and features, such as common dialogs, shell extensions, and ActiveX controls. VCL uses an integer in laying out the controls, which makes it faster and simpler.
 
Both frameworks have their pros and cons, and the choice depends on your project requirements and preferences. If you want to create a cross-platform application that can run on different devices and operating systems, or if you want to use advanced graphics and animations in your user interface, then FireMonkey may be a better option for you. If you want to create a Windows-only application that can leverage the native Windows features and components, or if you want to use existing VCL code and libraries in your project, then VCL may be a better option for you.
