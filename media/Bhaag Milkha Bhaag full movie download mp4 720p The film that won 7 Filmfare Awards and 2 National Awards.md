## Bhaag Milkha Bhaag: A Tribute to Milkha Singh
  
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is not just a film, but a tribute to Milkha Singh, who passed away on 18 June 2021 at the age of 91. Milkha Singh was a legend who left an indelible mark on Indian sports and inspired generations of athletes. He was also a humanitarian who donated his medals and awards to the nation and supported various causes.
  
Milkha Singh was born in 1929 in a village in Punjab, which is now part of Pakistan. He witnessed the horrors of the partition and lost his parents and siblings in the violence. He escaped to India and joined the Indian Army, where he discovered his talent for running. He trained hard and became one of the best sprinters in the world.
  
Milkha Singh represented India in four Olympics and won four gold medals at the Asian Games. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1958, becoming the first Indian to do so. He set a world record of 45.6 seconds in the 400 meters race at the 1960 Rome Olympics, but missed the bronze medal by a fraction of a second. He later regretted that he slowed down in the final stretch, thinking he had secured a medal.
