## Check the System Requirements
 
The first thing you need to do is to check if your system meets the minimum requirements for the game. According to Steam, these are:
 
- OS: Windows 7, 64-bit
- Processor: Intel Core i5-750 / AMD Phenom II X4 940
- Memory: 4 GB RAM
- Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 / AMD Radeon HD 6870
- DirectX: Version 11
- Storage: 12 GB available space

If your system does not meet these requirements, you may experience performance issues or crashes while playing the game. You may also need to lower the graphics settings or resolution to improve the framerate.
 
## Use a 64-bit Emulator
 
The next thing you need to do is to use a 64-bit emulator to run the game on your 32-bit system. An emulator is a software that mimics the behavior of another system or device. In this case, you will need an emulator that can run 64-bit applications on a 32-bit platform.
 
One of the most popular emulators for this purpose is [WoW64](https://www.wow64.net/). WoW64 stands for Windows-on-Windows 64-bit, and it is a subsystem of Windows that allows 32-bit versions of Windows to run 64-bit applications. WoW64 is included in most versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.
 
To use WoW64, you will need to download and install the [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17791) for your version of Windows. The SDK contains the tools and libraries that you need to create and run applications for Windows.
 
After installing the SDK, you will need to locate the WoW64 emulator executable file in your system. The file name is usually `wow64.exe`, and it is located in the `C:\Windows\SysWOW64` folder. You can also use the search function in Windows Explorer to find it.
 
Once you have found the file, you will need to create a shortcut for it on your desktop or any other convenient location. To do this, right-click on the file and select `Create shortcut`. Then, right-click on the shortcut and select `Properties`. In the `Target` field, add a space and then type the path of the game executable file that you want to run with WoW64. For example, if your game executable file is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MY HERO ONE'S JUSTICE\Binaries\Win64\MHOJ.exe`, then your target field should look like this:
